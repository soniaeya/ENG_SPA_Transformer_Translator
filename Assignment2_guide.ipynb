        "Have you ever wondered how applications like Google Translate or language translation features in social media platforms work? Behind these impressive technologies are sophisticated machine learning models that can understand and translate text between different languages. One of the most powerful and groundbreaking models used for this purpose is the Transformer model.\n",

        "In this assignment, you will step into the shoes of an AI researcher and engineer to create your own Transformer model for translating text from English to Spanish. This journey will not only enhance your understanding of machine learning and deep learning but also give you hands-on experience with state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing."
